Toolchain for arm processors
============================

Installing gcc-arm-none-eabi toolchain using, "sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi" -->[ps:don't install it like this GDB debugger is not working] 

-This toolchain provides the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) targeting the ARM architecture without any embedded operating system (bare-metal)
specifically for ARM Cortex-M and Cortex-R processors.

-This toolchain is widely used in embedded development for ARM microcontrollers, including STM32 devices.

-It produces executable binaries that are compatible with the ARM architecture used in these microcontrollers.

-ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers use a different architecture than typical desktop or server CPUs (e.g., x86). Therefore, you need a specialized toolchain like arm-none-eabi-gcc to generate code that runs on these microcontrollers.

-standard GCC compiler on our system doesn't recognize ARM-specific instructions or peripheral registers,so errors will be produced.

== Follow youtube video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imUiQkO9YHM from 2:21 to 7:55".
 
 -Upgrade and update apt-get packages using "sudo apt-get update" and "sudo apt-get upgrade"
 
 -Install wget using "sudo apt-get wget"
 
 -Go to link "https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm" and copy link of gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2[Linux
 x86_64 Tarball]
 
 -Run the command "wget https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-rm/10.3-2021.10/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2" [remove the part upto "?"] in Downloads folder(any folder would be fine).
 
 -use "tar -xjf gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2"
 
 -Now go to "/opt/" folder and create a folder by any name using "sudo mkdir gcc-arm"
 
 -Now move the extracted folder from downloads to /opt/gcc-arm/ folder using "sudo mv gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10/* /opt/gcc-arm"
 
 -Add the bin floder to PATH variable using "export PATH="/opt/gcc-arm/bin/:$PATH"
 
Even after this the GDB may not work, we may have to do the following process
 
vlab@HYVLAB1:/opt/gcc-arm$ dpkg -l | grep libncurses

ii  libncurses6:amd64                          6.2-0ubuntu2.1                      amd64        shared libraries for terminal handling

ii  libncursesw6:amd64                         6.2-0ubuntu2.1                      amd64        shared libraries for terminal handling (wide character support)

-Eventhough libncurses is there but not exact version so we need to give a symbolic link.

vlab@HYVLAB1:/opt/gcc-arm$ sudo ln -s /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libncurses.so.6 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libncurses.so.5

vlab@HYVLAB1:/opt/gcc-arm$ arm-none-eabi-gdb --version

arm-none-eabi-gdb: error while loading shared libraries: libtinfo.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory


-If it is still not working ,follow same process for libtinfo

vlab@HYVLAB1:/opt/gcc-arm$ dpkg -l | grep libtinfo

ii  libtinfo6:amd64                            6.2-0ubuntu2.1                      amd64        shared low-level terminfo library for terminal handling

vlab@HYVLAB1:/opt/gcc-arm$ sudo ln -s /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.6 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.5


vlab@HYVLAB1:/opt/gcc-arm$ arm-none-eabi-gdb --version

ST-LINK Utility
===============

stlink utilty installed from terminal "sudo apt install stlink-tools".

vlab@HYVLAB1:~$ sudo st-info --probe

Found 1 stlink programmers

 serial: 343f6a06304d583455350443
 
openocd: "\x34\x3f\x6a\x06\x30\x4d\x58\x34\x55\x35\x04\x43"

  flash: 524288 (pagesize: 16384)
  
   sram: 131072

  descr: F4 device (low power) - stm32f411re

-conlusion for stlink utility --> use the stlink utility downloaded from terminal "sudo apt install stlink-tools"
 and if the board is not connected perfectly with "sudo st-info --probe" then use  the forced option "sudo st-info --probe --connect-under-reset"
 
Compiling STM32F4-FreeRTOS 
==========================

Setting toolchain

-Compiling is possible only if "arm-none-eabi-gcc" tool chain is installed.

-Changed the variable "TOOLCHAIN_ROOT:=/usr/bin/" in Makefile of folder "STM32F4-FreeRTOS" to the folder where tool chain is installed, which was found using "which arm-none-eabi-gcc"-->"/usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc".

-Initially the variable "TOOLCHAIN_PATH:=$(TOOLCHAIN_ROOT)" in Makefile, was like "TOOLCHAIN_PATH:=$(TOOLCHAIN_ROOT)/bin" ,due to error 
"make: /usr/bin//bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc: Command not found",to remove the extra "/bin" we changed it.

-->Compiling

-->GDB Debugger

-Now to debug and observe the output ,It is recommended to use GDB server to debug and GTKTerm to observe the output if any print statements in the written code(Direct printf doesn't work we need to configure usart).

-To connect to GDB server -->"sudo st-util"

-if it says already in use then we have to kill the process -->execute this command "sudo lsof -i :4242".

vlab@HYVLAB1:~/STM32F4-FreeRTOS$ sudo lsof -i :4242

Use this PID to kill it -->"kill 15345"

-Make not of port number, which says "Listening at"

Observing output
================

To observe the print statements written in code, we will use GTKTerm serial window

-We cannot use printf in main file, we have send data using USART function USART_SendData
-Install GTKTerm directly from terminal "sudo apt install gtkterm"
-open the GTKTerm application and set the configurations
	-Select port as /dev/ttyUSB0.
	-Baud rate is usually 9600 or 115200 but in this case it is working with 1200 and 600.
	-Parity as none.
	-Bits as 8.
	-StopBits as 1.
	-Flow Control as none.
-In terminal we need to give permission for ttyUSB0 "sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0"
-RS232 cable will have 6 wires.
	-Yellow -> RX
	-Orange -> TX
	-Black -> gnd
	-Red -> 3.3v
	-Brown -> CTS#
	-RTS -> RTS#
-Connect Rx of RS232 cable to Tx pin on board and viceversa.
-We are using USART1 so PA9->Tx and PA10->Rx.
