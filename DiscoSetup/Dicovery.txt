>>Toolchain for arm cortex-m

-->installing gcc-arm-none-eabi toolchain using, "sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi" -->[ps:don't install it like this GDB debugger is not working] 
*This toolchain provides the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) targeting the ARM architecture without any embedded operating system (bare-metal)
specifically for ARM Cortex-M and Cortex-R processors.
*This toolchain is widely used in embedded development for ARM microcontrollers, including STM32 devices.
*It produces executable binaries that are compatible with the ARM architecture used in these microcontrollers.
*ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers use a different architecture than typical desktop or server CPUs (e.g., x86). Therefore, you need a specialized toolchain like arm-none-eabi-gcc to generate code that runs on these microcontrollers.
*standard GCC compiler on our system doesn't recognize ARM-specific instructions or peripheral registers,so errors will be produced.

 -->Follow youtube video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imUiQkO9YHM from 2:21 to 7:55"
 *Upgrade and update apt-get packages using "sudo apt-get update" and "sudo apt-get upgrade"
 *Install wget using "sudo apt-get wget"
 *Go to link "https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm" and copy link of gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2[Linux
 x86_64 Tarball]
 *Run the command "wget https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-rm/10.3-2021.10/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2" [remove the part upto "?"] in Downloads folder(any folder would be fine)
 *use "tar -xjf gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2"
 *Now go to "/opt/" folder and create a folder by any name using "sudo mkdir gcc-arm"
 *Now move the extracted folder from downloads to /opt/gcc-arm/ folder using "sudo mv gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10/* /opt/gcc-arm"
 *Add the bin floder to PATH variable using "export PATH="/opt/gcc-arm/bin/:$PATH"
 -->Even after this the GDB may not work, we may have to do the following process
 
 vlab@HYVLAB1:/opt/gcc-arm$ dpkg -l | grep libncurses
ii  libncurses6:amd64                          6.2-0ubuntu2.1                      amd64        shared libraries for terminal handling
ii  libncursesw6:amd64                         6.2-0ubuntu2.1                      amd64        shared libraries for terminal handling (wide character support)
*Eventhough libncurses is there but not exact version so we need to give a symbolic link
vlab@HYVLAB1:/opt/gcc-arm$ sudo ln -s /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libncurses.so.6 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libncurses.so.5
vlab@HYVLAB1:/opt/gcc-arm$ arm-none-eabi-gdb --version
arm-none-eabi-gdb: error while loading shared libraries: libtinfo.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

*If it is still not working ,follow same process for libtinfo
vlab@HYVLAB1:/opt/gcc-arm$ dpkg -l | grep libtinfo
ii  libtinfo6:amd64                            6.2-0ubuntu2.1                      amd64        shared low-level terminfo library for terminal handling
vlab@HYVLAB1:/opt/gcc-arm$ sudo ln -s /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.6 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.5

*This command creates a symbolic link (ln -s) in the /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ directory. The link is named libtinfo.so.5 and points to the file /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.6.

*Symbolic links allow multiple filenames to refer to the same file or directory. In this case, it appears to be an attempt to make a library file (libtinfo.so.5) point to another version (libtinfo.so.6). This is often done to resolve compatibility issues or to satisfy dependencies required by certain applications.

>>ST-LINK Utility

-->Install ST-Link utility
*Downloaded Source.zip from "https://github.com/stlink-org/stlink/releases"--Release v1.8.0
*Extracted the file 
*Installed cmake->"sudo apt install cmake" and lusb->"sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev" library
*Built the file using "make"
*Bulid folder is creted as a result of make
*In build --> bulid/Release/bin ,we can find utility tools like st-info,st-flash,etc
*To know whether the device connected or not we use "./bin/st-info --probe" ,but failed-->refer ErrorsDiscover.txt(section-1)[ps:Solved-> just removed and installed cmake,libusb and built the folder using make multiple times and use sudo with probing]

-->stlink utilty installed from terminal "sudo apt install stlink-tools"
*Working with only blue board perfectly, i.e detecting the board and recognizing the board when "st-info --probe" is used

-->stlink utilty which is downloaded from "https://github.com/stlink-org/stlink/releases"
*with blue board ,working perfectly i.e detection and recognizing when the command "./bin/st-info --probe" to execute this we should be in build/Release folder

vlab@HYVLAB1:~/stlink-1.8.0/build/Release$ sudo ./bin/st-info --probe

  sram:       0
  chipid:     0x431

*with green board(even with nucelo f401RE) ,board is being detected when command "./bin/st-info --probe" used ,but to make it connect perfectly we should use command "./bin/st-info --probe --connect-under-reset" 

vlab@HYVLAB1:~/stlink-1.8.0/build/Release$ sudo ./bin/st-info --probe --connect-under-reset

*conlusion for stlink utility --> use the stlink utility downloaded from "https://github.com/stlink-org/stlink/releases" and if the board is not connected perfectly with "sudo ./bin/st-info --probe" then use  the forced option "sudo ./bin/st-info --probe --connect-under-reset"

>>Compiling STM32F4-FreeRTOS cloned from "https://github.com/wangyeee/STM32F4-FreeRTOS"

-->Setting toolchain
*Compiling is possible only if "arm-none-eabi-gcc" tool chain is installed.STM32F4Discover
*Changed the variable "TOOLCHAIN_ROOT:=/usr/bin/" in Makefile of folder "STM32F4-FreeRTOS" to the folder where tool chain is installed, which was found using "which arm-none-eabi-gcc"-->"/usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc".
*Initially the variable "TOOLCHAIN_PATH:=$(TOOLCHAIN_ROOT)" in Makefile, was like "TOOLCHAIN_PATH:=$(TOOLCHAIN_ROOT)/bin" ,due to error 
"make: /usr/bin//bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc: Command not found",to remove the extra "/bin" we changed it.

-->Compiling
*Using make command to build/compile produced warnings like;
/home/vlab/STM32F4-FreeRTOS/hardware/system_stm32f4xx.c: In function 'SetSysClock':
/home/vlab/STM32F4-FreeRTOS/hardware/system_stm32f4xx.c:752:5: warning: this 'while' clause does not guard... [-Wmisleading-indentation]
